#Error Handling
In order to write robust and build reliable applications, youâ€™ll need to learn about error handling. Compared to other programming languages, Go takes a unique approach to error handling, encouraging you to handle problems explicitly and immediately rather than relying on exceptions.

In Go, errors are treated as values, which means they are returned from functions just like any other value and must be handled by the developer. This approach helps to promote clarity and also ensures that potential issues are dealt with at the point where they occur.
