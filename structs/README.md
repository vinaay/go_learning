#SWITCH 

The switch statement is a multi-directional branch that allows you to execute different blocks of code depending on the value of an expression. Itâ€™s easier to read than multiple if/else statements.

`go main.go`

In the code above, the output will be "Start of the week" because the day variable matches the Monday case.
